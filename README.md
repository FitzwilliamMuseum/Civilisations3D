# Iznik jug with English mounts

Era: c.1580-1593
Original Location: Turkey (Western Anatolia) and London, England
Material: Fritware, painted underglaze in blue, turquoise-green, red and black with pomegranates and hyacinths, mounted in silver-gilt
Dimensions: 14.2cm wide x 26.2cm high x 9.8cm in diameter
Object logline: Lidded jug / flagon from Iznik and London

This wheel-thrown fritware jug with ‘sealing-wax’ red hyacinths and cobalt blue pomegranates was made in Iznik (Western Anatolia), 
a renowned ceramics centre during the Ottoman Empire. It’s characteristic of late sixteenth-century production: the bright red colour 
was only used from 1560 onwards. 
The jug was exported to Elizabethan London where, in 1592/3, it was fitted with fashionable silver-gilt mounts to protect its edges. 
Although it’s shaped like a jug, it was actually meant for drinking ale or beer. As a French visitor remarked in 1558, the English drank 
beer “not out of glasses but from earthen pots with silver handles and covers and this even in houses of persons of middling fortune”.
Iznikware examples such as this were expensive luxury items used only by the upper classes. The less affluent had to make do with 
German stoneware imports, or English earthenware ones. The sliver mount has been pricked with the initials ‘E T’. 
These are almost certainly the initials of Elizabeth Tollemache, a very powerful and well-educated woman, who lived at Ham House, 
Surrey from 1655 until her death in 1699.

### Story 1: A treasured possession
The identity of the first owner of this jug is unknown, but he or she must have valued it very highly to have it mounted with 
gilded silver.  The handle-mount was subsequently pricked with the letters ‘E T’, almost certainly the initials of Elizabeth 
Tollemache, Countess of Dysart. She may have inherited the jug from her father, William Murray along with the family home, 
Ham House, where the jug remained a treasured possession until 1948. 

### Story 2: Historical ambivalence between East and West
British attitudes to Turks were ambivalent in the 16th and 17th centuries. As contact between the Ottoman Empire and England increased, 
the Turk became a common and stereotypically villainous figure on the British stage. A reference in Shakespeare’s Othello to a 
‘malignant and turban’d Turk… the circumcis’d dog’ is typically abusive. This attitude was based upon the long-standing antipathy 
between the Islamic East and the Christian West.

### Story 3: Fascination with the Orient
Near Eastern material culture was highly valued in Elizabethan England. In early 1582, diplomacy between the English court and that 
of the Ottoman Sultan Murad III led to the founding of The Turkish Company – later called The Levant Company – which facilitated trade 
between Turkey and England.

### Story 4: 	A burst of colour
The design is typical of 16th century Iznikware, with red hyacinths and cobalt blue pomegranates standing out against a clean, bright, white background. The brilliant colours were the innovation of Turkish artists who had previously imitated the blue-on-white decoration of Chinese porcelain. 
The stylised vegetation was intended to evoke the miracle of Allah’s creations, with Muslims believing pomegranate trees to be holy. Iznik tiles with floral decoration were, and still are, made to decorate the interiors of mosques.
		
# Red-figure neck amphora 

Era: Ancient Greece c. 480-470 BC
Original Location: Athens 
Material:  Clay
Dimensions: 34cm high x 22.4cm wide

This red-figured vessel was made in Athens c. 480 BC - 470 BC. On one side you can see the hero Theseus performing one of his twelve 
labours and about to kill the Attic villain, Procrustes, who attacked travellers. Procrustes’ gruesome method was to force strangers to 
lie down on a bed and then he would either hammer his victims to lengthen them or chop their extremities to make them fit the bed. 

The drama of his own punishment is heightened in this somewhat hasty drawing by the fact that the deed is not quite done. The 
axe-wielding Theseus has wounded Procrustes who struggles to protect himself with an inoffensive-looking hammer. Theseus was also 
a king, credited with creation a union of Attic communities under the leadership of Athens.

The other side of the amphora shows the amorous advance of the dawn deity, Eos, upon the handsome youth, Tithonos, who she later 
arranged to have immortalised. However, having forgotten to seek eternal youth for him, she eventually shut the chattering old man 
up in a bed-chamber.

### Story 1: The painting technique

In the late 6th century BC, the technical development in Greek vase design saw pot painters applying black glaze for the background and 
using the reserve red ground from the iron-rich clay for the figures. This reversing of media is termed red-figure painting. 
The advantage for the artisan was that he could paint in outline, filling in the background afterwards. For a while, black- and 
red-figure painting co-existed, but the red-figure technique became more commonplace.

### Story 2: Eos, the goddess of the dawn

Eos, goddess of the dawn and daughter of Hyperion and the Titaness Theia, was goddess of the dawn, responsible for the rising of the 
sun each morning. She is sometimes shown driving a chariot. She had the misfortune to be cursed by Aphrodite to fall for lots of young 
men.  

On this vase she is seen advancing upon the handsome youth Tithonos, who she later arranged to have immortalised. However, having 
forgotten to seek eternal youth for him, she eventually shut the chattering old man up in a bed-chamber.

### Story 3: 
The subject on one side of the vase is the hero Theseus performing one of his twelve labours and about to kill the Attic Villain,
Procrustes, who attacked travellers.  Procrustes forced strangers to lie down on a bed and then would either hammer his victims to 
lengthen them or chop their extremities, to make them fit the bed.
